# Spatio-Temporal_Statistics-IV
All of my R code from the Spatio & Temporal Statistics IV module at Durham University, including work done in computer practical classes and examinations, taken as a 4th year student in 2024/2025. The module was split into analysing spatial data and time series data. The main spatial topics include geostatistical data, and aerial data modelling. The main temporal topics include ARMA models, Hidden Markov models, and dynamic linear models.
